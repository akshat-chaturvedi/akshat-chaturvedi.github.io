Closure Phases:
Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere corrupts the phase of the fringes at optical and near-infrared wavelengths.  To recover the phase information, we combine the phases measured in a closed triangle of three telescopes in a way that cancels out the atmospheric turbulence.  This quantity is called the closure phase.  The closure phase is sensitive asymmetries in the source distribution.  A point-symmetric target will have a closure phase of either 0 or 180 degrees (depending on how well the source is resolved).  A source that is not point-symmetric will have non-zero closure phases.  This includes binaries where the component stars have different brightnesses, a star with a bright or dark spot on the stellar surface, or an asymmetric circumstellar disk around a star.  The size the closure phase signal and how it varies across different baselines (or wavelengths) reveals information about the structure of the source.

Small CP signals unambiguously point toward the presence of very high-contrast companions at separations of a few mas. (Klement et al. 2022 AJ 926:213)
